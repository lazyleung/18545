18545 lab 1 report notes
========================

## Group's process
+ We chose the virtex 5 board
+ Found some Xilinx docs online to figure out how to use the tools
+ One of the board programmers didn't work correctly so we got a new one
+ We ran into the issue where sometimes the tools complain that the drivers
  aren't loaded, seems that we need to restart the machine to fix it.
+ We programmed a simple task that XORs the first four bits and last four bits
  of the DIP switches and displays the output on the LEDs

+ We configured our board to also print HELLO FOO based off of the provided LCD
  code.

+ We plan to use git as our version control system. We are using a private git
  repository on bitbucket.
+ The project documentation is on a Google drive shared folder everyone has
  access to. We are using the google drive formats.
+ David had nominated himself to be the keeper of schedule.
